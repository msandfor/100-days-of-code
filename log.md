# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 9th 2019 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Forked the repo, downloaded a bunch of tools: bash, node.js, powershell, LUIS etc. Started in the Azure portal building a web app bot that will be a virtual assistant. Also started some prep for a twitter bot using python. 

**Thoughts:** There's a lot of prep work outside of the actual code. But the instructions are really good these days, so I'm optimistic. Turns out it might take a few days to get developer keys from Twitter, new rules they seem to have introduced within the last 6 months

**Link to work:** Nothing to see here yet :-( 

### Day 1: March 10th 2019 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Did some more stuff in Azure with the AI Bots and found some more Python chatbots to play with. I also played codecombat for an hour, to practice my python skills

**Thoughts**: Lots of stuff is out of date, libraries don't match. PIL has not been ported to Python 3 yet and I don't have a clear understanding of how to get similar functionality out of other standard libraries. The research part is not as fun as the coding part and it's frustrating to try and do and understand stuff when it doesn't work anymore. But little by little I am progressing.

**Link(s) to work**: I started some files for each day so you can see the code I am playing with.

### Day 2: March 11th 2019 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: Got my Twitter developer access. Solved some more problems in CodeCombat.

**Thoughts** I need to do this at the start of the day, I'm too tired at night.
