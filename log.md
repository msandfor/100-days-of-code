# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 9th 2019 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Forked the repo, downloaded a bunch of tools: bash, node.js, powershell, LUIS etc. Started in the Azure portal building a web app bot that will be a virtual assistant. Also started some prep for a twitter bot using python. 

**Thoughts:** There's a lot of prep work outside of the actual code. But the instructions are really good these days, so I'm optimistic. Turns out it might take a few days to get developer keys from Twitter, new rules they seem to have introduced within the last 6 months

**Link to work:** Nothing to see here yet :-( 

### Day 1: March 10th 2019 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Did some more stuff in Azure with the AI Bots and found some more Python chatbots to play with. I also played codecombat for an hour, to practice my python skills

**Thoughts**: Lots of stuff is out of date, libraries don't match. PIL has not been ported to Python 3 yet and I don't have a clear understanding of how to get similar functionality out of other standard libraries. The research part is not as fun as the coding part and it's frustrating to try and do and understand stuff when it doesn't work anymore. But little by little I am progressing.

**Link(s) to work**: I started some files for each day so you can see the code I am playing with.

### Day 2: March 11th 2019 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: Got my Twitter developer access. Solved some more problems in CodeCombat.

**Thoughts** I need to do this at the start of the day, I'm too tired at night.

### Day 3: March 12th 2019 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Under the recommendation of @nnja I started the python build a github bot tutorial by @Mariatta

**Thoughts** An hour is not enough to feel like I'm making progress. I don't want to stop when I get it, and I do want to stop when I'm frustrated, but my brain calls me a quitter if I stop then.

I did another hour this evening, and I feel better. Not everything works as expected, but I am able to do a bit of limited troubleshooting and really enjoyed how far I got tonight. Everything I learn leads to more questions though.

### Day 4: March 13th 2019 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: It wasn't quite working last night, so I redid some aspects of the bot and went a bit further. The first part is complete now, it's deployed in Heroku and it responded to a comment in my repository!

**Thoughts** I thought I'd have to redo everything, but it's more like 2 steps forward and 1 step back. Just when you think it won't work, it does.

### Day 5: March 14th 2019 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Did a Kubernetes workshop.

**Thoughts** Discovered sometimes it's not me, it's you. i.e. I didn't have all those lines of red code because of mistakes I was making. All my Microsoft buddies got the same error when using our work subscription. So something was locked down for us. But I also saw stuff that everyone knows how to do, I wouldn't have known how to do 2 weeks ago, and now I did it as quickly as they did.

### Day 6: March 15th 2019 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continued with my Python Github bot, I'm now trying to get it to Say thanks when an issue has been mergedÂ¶

**Thoughts** I know now why developers have so many screens, it really would be easier if I could see the documentation on one screen and the instructions, and then the code screen in another. There is not enough room on one screen for 3 windows.

### Day 7: March 16th 2019 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Python bot from @Marietta - I mean not all the optional extras, just the standard part

**Thoughts** I'll probably move on and try other tutorials, and then come back to the extras as I become more confident.

### Day 8: March 17th 2019 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Woke up with a headache, so decided to play codecombat until the drugs kicked in. Then I looked at NLP chatbots from @ParulNith and was able to figure out why ROBO wasn't running and get it going. Followed the Azure learning path: Create Intelligent Bots and built a Bot using Q and A maker, attached it to a web app 

**Thoughts** Discovered that sometimes I can't see the errors in my code, no matter how long I stare at it, and then after I wiped the whole page and started from scratch - I did it perfectly the first time. Most of the time I think I can't do stuff from scratch, I always need to build on other peoples work, or see an example before I can do my own. And then this happens. Following the learning path to create the Q&A bot was fun and easy. I'm eager to do more like that.
