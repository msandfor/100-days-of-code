# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 9th 2019 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Forked the repo, downloaded a bunch of tools: bash, node.js, powershell, LUIS etc. Started in the Azure portal building a web app bot that will be a virtual assistant. Also started some prep for a twitter bot using python. 

**Thoughts:** There's a lot of prep work outside of the actual code. But the instructions are really good these days, so I'm optimistic. Turns out it might take a few days to get developer keys from Twitter, new rules they seem to have introduced within the last 6 months

**Link to work:** Nothing to see here yet :-(
